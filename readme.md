For Q1 and Q2, you need to use IRIS dataset available at - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris

Q1. Implement two perceptron model to perform classification on iris database from scratch. You should not be using any inbuilt function for this implementation (except reading the data).
(a) vary the learning rate and show the best learning rate value when your run it for 50 epochs.
(b) vary the number of epochs from 10 to 100 in a step of 10 and show the loss value curve (using the best learning rate obtained from (a))

Q2. Implement a 3-class backpropagation NNet on your own to classify iris data, i.e. from scratch. You should not be using any inbuilt function for this implementation (except reading the data).
(a) vary the learning rate and show the best learning rate value when your run it for 50 epochs.
(b) vary the number of epochs from 10 to 100 in a step of 10 and show the loss value curve (using the best learning rate obtained from (a))
(c) add L2 regularization - show the comparisons with and without this regularization and analyze your results.

Q3. Use any toolbox in python and implement RBF NNet to solve one of the problems/databases (of your choice from the UCI ML database Repo). Analyze your results with respect to varying learning rate and epochs. You are not allowed to use someone's code available online. UCI databases: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php

Q4. Using MNIST database, code Autoencoder model with three encoding and three decoding layers. Show the visualization of the feature maps. On the features, add a classifier to perform 10-class classification and show the training loss curve and test accuracy.
